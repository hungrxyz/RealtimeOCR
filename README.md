# RealtimeOCR
Realtime OCR with Tesseract and OpenCV

Idea behind this project is to recreate the iTunes iOS App's gift card code scanner.

Demo:

[Cropped rectangle returned from OpenCV](Images.xcassets/ishot_2.imageset/IMG_0709.PNG)
[Xcode output after applying OCR on the cropped image](Images.xcassets/xshot.imageset/Screen%20Shot%202015-02-25%20at%2003.39.27.png)

This is my first project with OpenCV and Tesseract so any improvements are welcome.
